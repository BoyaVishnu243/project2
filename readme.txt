This HTML script creates a simple calculator with buttons for digits,
operators (+, -, *, /), equals (=), and a clear (C) button.
The display is read-only, and the user can input values by clicking the buttons.
The eval function is used to perform the calculation when the equals button is clicked.
Note that using eval can have security implications and should be used carefully.
